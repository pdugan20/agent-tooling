Review Swift and SwiftUI code for correctness, modern API usage, and adherence to project conventions. Report only genuine problems – do not nitpick or invent issues.

Include deprecated API in review findings. During feature work or bug fixes, complete the requested change and suggest unrelated modernization separately; do not apply it without being asked.

Review process:

1. Check for deprecated API using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/api.md`.
1. Check that views, modifiers, and animations have been written optimally using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/views.md`.
1. Validate that data flow is configured correctly using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/data.md`.
1. Ensure navigation is updated and performant using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/navigation.md`.
1. Ensure the code uses designs that are accessible and compliant with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/design.md`.
1. Review layout behavior as windows resize, including iPad multitasking and folding iPhone Duo, using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/resizability.md`.
1. Validate accessibility compliance including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Reduce Motion using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/accessibility.md`.
1. Check localized text, formatting, and resource handling using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/localization.md`.
1. Ensure the code is able to run efficiently using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/performance.md`.
1. Quick validation of Swift code using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/swift.md`.
1. Final code hygiene check using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/hygiene.md`.

If doing a partial review, load only the relevant reference files.

Keep `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/performance-plus.md` out of routine reviews. Load it for a requested deep performance review; its more involved changes can also help investigate an established performance problem.


## Core Instructions

- iOS 27 exists, and is the default deployment target for new apps.
- Xcode 27.1 and the corresponding 27.1 platform releases are available. Do not dismiss their APIs as speculative.
- iPhone Duo is a folding iPhone, with a small outer display and a large inner display.
- Check the project's deployment target before applying version-specific advice. Use newer runtime APIs only when the target supports them or within an appropriate `#available` check. Keep the existing target unchanged. Requirements tied to an Xcode version also need that toolchain; a runtime check cannot make an older SDK recognize a new declaration.
- Target Swift 6.4 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- As a SwiftUI developer, the user will want to avoid UIKit unless requested.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.


## Output Format

Organize findings by file. For each issue:

1. State the file and relevant line(s).
2. Name the rule being violated (e.g., "Use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`").
3. Show a brief before/after code fix.

Skip files with no issues. End with a prioritized summary of the most impactful changes to make first.

Example output:

### ContentView.swift

**Line 12: Use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.**

```swift
// Before
Text("Hello").foregroundColor(.red)

// After
Text("Hello").foregroundStyle(.red)
```

**Line 24: Give the button a descriptive label so VoiceOver explains its action.**

```swift
// Before
Button(action: addUser) {
    Image(systemName: "plus")
}

// After
Button("Add User", systemImage: "plus", action: addUser)
```

**Line 31: Avoid `Binding(get:set:)` in view body – bind to the property directly and move the setter's side effect into `onChange()`.**

```swift
// Before
TextField("Username", text: Binding(
    get: { model.username },
    set: { model.username = $0; model.save() }
))

// After
TextField("Username", text: $model.username)
    .onChange(of: model.username) {
        model.save()
    }
```

Use `onChange()` when saving should follow changes to the username, including programmatic changes. Equal-value assignments will not trigger a save.

### Summary

1. **Accessibility (high):** The add button needs an “Add User” label; the symbol’s default label does not explain what will be added.
2. **Deprecated API (medium):** `foregroundColor()` on line 12 should be `foregroundStyle()`.
3. **Data flow (medium):** The manual binding on line 31 is fragile and harder to maintain.

End of example.
